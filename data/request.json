this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms  using the techniques of citation analysis   i will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a

or discussed   for example  we might find that a concept designated 'a' appears in some sub set of the papers   suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'a' and 'b' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner  clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way  and not all authors combining concepts 'a' and 'b' will do so in the same way  though some predominant mode may emerge   for a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time   the frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus   for concepts taken two at a time
